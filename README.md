# S3-backed HTML/JavaScript Audio player

Claudio is a web-base audio player that can play audio files directly from your own S3 bucket. It allows you to keep all of your music in one place and play on any of your connected devices. 

The existing feature set currently is very basic:

+ List songs in a tree structure
+ Click to play songs
+ Display album pictures if contained in the same directory as the currently played song
+ Repeat single song
+ Randomize next song

Planned features in tentative priority order include

+ Write setup script (probably using AWS CLI)
+ Playlists
+ Playlist and status syncing across devices
+ Styling
